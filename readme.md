## 2. Delete product functionality with confirmation [x]

## 3. Add review [x]

### 3.1 All reviews section

#### 3.1.1 Listing all reviews [x]

#### 3.1.2 Current user review (if he has left a review for this product) should be first, the rest would be sorted from newest to oldest

#### 3.1.3 Details page should show average product rating and reviews count [x]

#### 3.1.5 As soon as the users adds his review, details page should update with new rating [x]

##### 3.1.5.1 and removed add review button

#### 3.1.6 Once a user has reviewed a product, he should not be able to review it again / only edit or delete his review

### 3.2 Edit review functionality from section reviews

### 3.3 Delete review functionality from section reviews

## 4. Add to cart не работи- трябва да пише колко бройки остават от всеки размер и да не позволява да се избере повече от тях като количество

### 4.1 Details page should show how many items left in stock from each size and should not let user choose more than this amount

## 5. Cart section - shows current user's cart from latest to oldest items added

### 5.1 Button for delete should remove item from user's cart

### 5.2 Each item should be a link to its details page (on title hover maybe)
