# Plan

## 6. Catalog

#### 6.1.2 Search field should be reset and a text "results for: \_\_\_" should be shown

## 7. Checkout

### 7.1 Cart - items that were in stock in time of adding to cart but are now out of stock or with not enough quantity should have a message to inform user

### 7.2 Cart -> Next step -> add items from cart for checkout only if it is not out of stock or if it is not a higher quantity than the in stock quantity
